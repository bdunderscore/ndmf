## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Fixed

### Changed

### Removed

  to that package) 

### Security

### Deprecated

## [1.8.0-alpha.9] - [2025-04-22]

### Fixed
- [#602] Fix issue where, if the hidden "mask" value on the gesture layer in the VRChat avatar controller was missing,
  the avatar would be stuck in "bicycle pose" in gesture manager and Av3Emulator.

### Fixed
- [#590] `[RunsOnPlatforms]` and `[RunsOnAllPlatforms]` did not work when applied to a pass class. 
- [#597] Fixed an issue where duplicate layer entries in the VRChat Avatar Descriptor would cause all animator contents
  to be ignored.

### Fixed
- [#587] NDMF plugins that modify animators would cause AnimatorLayerControl behaviors to be lost
- [#588] Animator Play Audio paths are not correctly remapped in Merge Animator

## [1.8.0-alpha.5] - [2025-04-08]

  - NDMF will use the last instance of the parameter defined.

### Changed
- [#584] NDMF AnimatorServicesContext will detect when other NDMF plugins have replaced proxy clips with a clone, and

## [1.8.0-alpha.4] - [2025-04-07]

### Added

#### Added (experimental features)
- Added internal APIs and components to support experimental Resonite backend support.
  - These components are very much subject to change in future builds (and are hidden behind the NDMF_EXPERIMENTAL feature flag)

## [1.8.0-alpha.3] - [2025-04-06]

### Added

#### Added (experimental features)
These features are only accessible if you set `NDMF_EXPERIMENTAL` as a script define in your project settings,
and are subject to change in future releases (are not subject to semver).

- Added platform selection UI to the build window. Note that this is displayed only if `NDMF_EXPERIMENTAL` is set as a
  script define.
- Added `NDMF Avatar Root` experimental component.

### Fixed
- [#573] Fixed an issue where additive reference pose clip references in animator override controllers resulted in a
  build failure

### Changed
- [#574] Adjusted the API for platform compatibility declaration
- Disabled platform filtering for the moment. This will be enabled in an experimental package in a later change.

## [1.8.0-alpha.0] - [2025-04-05]

### Added
- [#572] Added `Sequence.OnAllPlatforms()` and `Sequence.OnPlatforms()` methods, and the `WellKnownPlatforms` class.
  - These are in preparation for NDMF's multiplatform support, and configure which platforms passes run on.
  - By default, passes run only on VRChat SDK 3.0.
- [#572] Added `[RunsOnAllPlatforms]` and `[RunsOnPlatform]` attributes as well

## [1.7.4] - [2025-04-05]

## [1.7.2-rc.0] - [2025-04-03]

- The `IVirtualizedMotion` interface was incorrectly exposed in the `API` namespace. It has been moved to `nadena.dev.ndmf.animator` instead.
  **This is a semver breaking change**

- [#567] "Unreachable code reached???" error on some animators
- [#568] VirtualClip did not support discrete curves

## [1.7.1] - [2025-04-02]

## [1.7.0-alpha.2] - [2025-03-10]

Note: This alpha release contains breaking changes to APIs introduced in `alpha.0` and `alpha.1`.
Please upgrade modular avatar at the same time as updating to this release. This does not affect
stable APIs.

### Added

### Added
- [#467] Added the `AnimatorServicesContext` and lots of supporting APIs for working with animator controllers.

## [1.6.8] - [2025-02-16]

### Fixed
- Avoid NRE that occurs when a null is observed in a PublishedValue (#526)

## [1.6.7] - [2025-01-26]

### Fixed
- Fixed another source of NullReferenceErrors after deleting game objects (#522)

## [1.6.6] - [2025-01-25]

### Fixed
- NullReferenceErrors when there are missing components, breaking scene view movement (#520)

## [1.6.5] - [2025-01-24]

### Fixed
- Performance improvements (#515 #516)
- "Test build" button is disabled after test-building an avatar that is not a scene root (#518)

## [1.6.4] - [2025-01-18]

### Fixed
- [#507] Fixed a potential editor freeze bug

### Removed
- [#507] Removed the `NDMFSyncContext.RunOnMainThread` API which was accidentally addded in 1.6.3.
  This might be re-added in 1.7.0.

## [1.6.3] - [2025-01-15]

### Fixed
- [#500] Fixed a thread-safety issue which could cause various issues, including editor performance degradation.
- [#506] Fixed an issue with the preview preferences dialog

## [1.6.2] - [2024-12-04]

### Added
- [#486] Add Simplified Chinese support
### Fixed
- [#487] Fixed a performance issue where all assets would potentially be loaded on reimport, taking a lot of time and
  memory in the process

## [1.6.1] - [2024-11-28]

**This release does not confirm to semver**. Due to unexpected compatibility issues with `IExtensionContext.Owner`, this
release removes this API. Although this is technically a semver violation, it's better than the accidental violation in
1.6.0.

**Note**: In 1.7.0 NDMF will add sentinel default methods to all interfaces to ensure that downstream packages are not
using outdated versions of C# to build. The NDMF project will not consider this to be a breaking change after 1.7.0.
Please update your projects to build with modern C# before then.

### Fixed
- [#482] Additional performance improvements

### Removed
- [#483] Removed `IExtensionContext.Owner` due to compatibility issues.

## [1.6.0] - [2024-11-28]

### Added
- [#479] Added `IAssetSaver` and `SerializationScope` APIs.
  - NDMF plugins are encouraged to use `IAssetSaver.SaveAsset` instead of directly accessing `AssetContainer`. This will
    split saved assets across multiple files, to avoid performance degradation as the number of assets in a container
    grows.
- [#480] Added `IExtensionContext.Owner` API. Setting this property will allow errors to be correctly attributed to the
  plugin that contains an extension context.
- [#472] [#474] Added the `DependsOnContext` attribute, for declaring dependencies between extension contexts.
- [#473] Added `BuildContext.SetEnableUVDistributionRecalculation` to allow opting out from the automatic call to
  `Mesh.RecalculateUVDistributionMetrics` on generated meshes.
- [#478] Added `ProfilerScope` API
- [#481] Added `NDMFPreview.GetOriginalObjectForProxy` API

### Fixed
- [#479] Unpacking generated asset containers can break inter-asset references

## [1.5.7] - [2024-11-17]

### Changed
- [#468] Performance improvements
- [#471] Improve compatibility with VRChat's streaming mipmaps feature
  - NDMF will now call `Mesh.RecalculateUVDistributionMetrics` on all generated meshes on upload. An API to opt-out will
    be provided at the next major version release.

## [1.5.6] - [2024-10-19]

### Fixed

- [#461] Selection outlines in scene view do not work reliably when preview system is active
- [#459] "Proxy object was destroyed improperly! Resetting pipeline..." error appears frequently
- [#460] Preview system fails to recover when the primary proxy is destroyed
- [#462] NDMF console fails to appear when an ExtensionContext throws an exception

## [1.5.5] - [2024-10-15]

### Fixed

  mode)
- [#441] Fixed an issue where the preview object pickable status could get out of sync with the original
- [#444] Fixed an issue where the preview system broke drag-and-drop of materials onto the scene view
- [#444] Fixed an issue where the preview system broke drag-to-select in the scene view

### Changed

  texture set, to ensure that Game Mode behaves as expected.

## [1.5.4] - [2024-10-05]

### Added

- [#439] Added a menu option to disable NDMF processing on build (`Tools -> NDM Framework -> Apply on Build`).
