### Fixed
- [#500] Fixed a thread-safety issue which could cause various issues, including editor performance degradation.
- [#506] Fixed an issue with the preview preferences dialog

## [1.6.2] - [2024-12-04]

### Added
- [#486] Add Simplified Chinese support
### Fixed
- [#487] Fixed a performance issue where all assets would potentially be loaded on reimport, taking a lot of time and
  memory in the process

## [1.6.1] - [2024-11-28]

**This release does not confirm to semver**. Due to unexpected compatibility issues with `IExtensionContext.Owner`, this
release removes this API. Although this is technically a semver violation, it's better than the accidental violation in
1.6.0.

**Note**: In 1.7.0 NDMF will add sentinel default methods to all interfaces to ensure that downstream packages are not
using outdated versions of C# to build. The NDMF project will not consider this to be a breaking change after 1.7.0.
Please update your projects to build with modern C# before then.

### Fixed
- [#482] Additional performance improvements

### Removed
- [#483] Removed `IExtensionContext.Owner` due to compatibility issues.

## [1.6.0] - [2024-11-28]

### Added
- [#479] Added `IAssetSaver` and `SerializationScope` APIs.
  - NDMF plugins are encouraged to use `IAssetSaver.SaveAsset` instead of directly accessing `AssetContainer`. This will
    split saved assets across multiple files, to avoid performance degradation as the number of assets in a container
    grows.
- [#480] Added `IExtensionContext.Owner` API. Setting this property will allow errors to be correctly attributed to the
  plugin that contains an extension context.
- [#472] [#474] Added the `DependsOnContext` attribute, for declaring dependencies between extension contexts.
- [#473] Added `BuildContext.SetEnableUVDistributionRecalculation` to allow opting out from the automatic call to
  `Mesh.RecalculateUVDistributionMetrics` on generated meshes.
- [#478] Added `ProfilerScope` API
- [#481] Added `NDMFPreview.GetOriginalObjectForProxy` API

### Fixed
- [#479] Unpacking generated asset containers can break inter-asset references

## [1.5.7] - [2024-11-17]

### Changed
- [#468] Performance improvements
- [#471] Improve compatibility with VRChat's streaming mipmaps feature
  - NDMF will now call `Mesh.RecalculateUVDistributionMetrics` on all generated meshes on upload. An API to opt-out will
    be provided at the next major version release.

## [1.5.6] - [2024-10-19]

### Fixed

- [#461] Selection outlines in scene view do not work reliably when preview system is active
- [#459] "Proxy object was destroyed improperly! Resetting pipeline..." error appears frequently
- [#460] Preview system fails to recover when the primary proxy is destroyed
- [#462] NDMF console fails to appear when an ExtensionContext throws an exception

## [1.5.5] - [2024-10-15]

### Fixed

- [#454] Scene view selection outlines flicker in some cases
- [#450] Improved performance when a large number of object change events are generated (e.g. when exiting animation
  mode)
- [#441] Fixed an issue where the preview object pickable status could get out of sync with the original
- [#444] Fixed an issue where the preview system broke drag-and-drop of materials onto the scene view
- [#444] Fixed an issue where the preview system broke drag-to-select in the scene view

### Changed

- [#451] Changed preview system to apply to more cameras. Specifically, we now handle all cameras with no render
  texture set, to ensure that Game Mode behaves as expected.

## [1.5.4] - [2024-10-05]

### Added

- [#439] Added a menu option to disable NDMF processing on build (`Tools -> NDM Framework -> Apply on Build`).
  - This setting will survive domain reloads but not editor restarts.

## [1.5.3] - [2024-10-03]

- [#416] Fixed issues where assets would not properly be tracked due to C# object recreation edge cases
